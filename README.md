## Introduction

You are living in the wilderness of Arizona together with your uncle.
If living with the nagging chap would not be enough, you're also surrounded by hungry wolves.
In order to keep them away you have to make sure your fire is burning.

But thankfully you have your trusty Pipe Tomahawk!
It is more than just a weapon.
It allows you to chop wood for the fire and it can be used as a pipe.
By sitting down and having a smoke with your uncle, you can keep him entertained.
And you better do unless you want the old man to fumble with your fire!
Sure he only wants to help, but he was never good with keeping a fire burning...
